01/23/2024 Product Vision Statement
The Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) Avionics System Capstone (MASC) team will be continuing work from CS 490 on a systems model of a generic Crewed Cislunar Station (CCS). 
The CCS will be modelled with SysML with the Dassault Systemes MagicDraw™ software following the MagicGrid™ methodology published by Dassault Systems. The MASC team will model
the Avionics system of the CCS to a sufficient extented in the white-box perspective of the problem domain, to generate conceptual Failure-Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) data using
the Dassault Systemes Safety and Reliability Toolbox™. The deliverables in this semester will be a detailed conceptual model of a CCS avionics system, using the SysML language,
and an FMEA report of the CCS, which demonstrates the application of systems modelling to FMEA and safety related system analysis.
