# Walter Engineering Cuaderno

This notebook's purpose is to keep track of my work done in the project and for the team.

## Sprint 1

Tasks part of
* Initialized Github and Jira
* Literature Review on MagicGrid used on avionics systems.
* Overview on the MagicGrid standards and workflow. 
* Helped design the Jira workflow and its point system
* Discussed with team the best course of action for meetings.
* SDD v1 

**09/01/2023**
* Meeting with NASA.
* Discussed about project and what to expect. 

**09/05/2023**
* Finalized a few ideas and how to move on. 
* Started MagicDraw license request. 
* Pain begins

**09/12/2023**
* Started discussion of product vision 
* Setup Github 
* Setup Jira

**09/15/2023**
* Started on SRS
* Started Literature Review
* Looked and review the first steps of MagicGrid book

**09/19/2023**
* More literature review on products and steps out there.
* Discussed possible future work and accomplishments
* Kathryn defined as our mentor/advisor with MagicGrid



Sprint 1 was a very deep planning phase. The project we are attempting to do 
is a subject that is not similar to any single team member (MBSE). Lots
of extensive reseach and literature review was done in order to get the team
familiar with new introduced MBSE methodology. We had a huge block which was 
getting the licenses for MagicDraw as soon as possible. We also had to 
change our scope and actors of the project as per the requirements of 
the licenses.


## Sprint 2

Tasks part of 

* Finalize Literature Review
* Meet with MagicGrid advisor for clear information
* Create System Context Diagram
* Revise and create stakeholder needs
* Read on Conceptual System diagram
* Create Use Case scenario for Use Case
* Test Plan v1 
* SRS v2
* SDD v2
* Planned new meeting times

**10/09/2023**
* Started process to get 2 other licenses

**10/16/2023**
* Got my license setup
* Discussed some miscommunication between the licenses

**10/23/2023**
* Move meeting times. 
* Started the research on how to make Github and MagicDraw work

**10/25/2023**
* Literature review non-stop 
* Tried to derive stakeholder needs

**10/27/2023**
* Spoke to Kathryn for verification on stakeholder needs and system context

**10/30/2023**
* Worked on the making of the Use Case Diagram
* Started the process of an Activity Diagram(Use Case Scenario)



Sprint 2 started much better than Sprint 1 as the team was able to acquire 
the licenses. But the team was only able to get 2 licenses, and 4 in total 
was needed for the whole team. The team had to speak to the school and agreed
to pay from packet the remaining 2 licenses, one of each was mine. Regardless
the team started creating and designing the first models available. The only 
major blockade the team encountered was having to figure out how to work concurrently
in the project. Many of the diagram, if not all, made it very hard to work on 
alone. The team found themselves having to discuss a lot of the process and things
we wanted to model. Although the end goal seems a bit tight to reach, the 
team started to pick up the pace and found a system that works to faciliate
and accelarate the progress. 



## Sprint 3

Tasks part of

* SDD Final Version
* SRS Final Version
* Use Case Scenario Diagram(Activity Diagram)
* Functional Analysis Diagram
* Helped with the development of MoEs Diagram 
* Rework on already designed diagrams.
* End of semester presentation. 

Sprint 3 was the sprint the team was able to split the work between the team members.
Previous sprints, the team didn't have experience with the tool so we spent 
lots of time just trying to figure out functionalities of the MagicDraw tool. 
I was given the task to on 2 digrams, Activity Diagram and Functional Analysis
along with another team member, and helped on the creating on one more, MoEs. 
Each diagram took a lot of time to integrate as we found lots of inconsistencies,
and we found ourselves going back to some already done diagrams to reflect our 
new findings. The good side is that MagicDraw does a good job at iteration work.
By this I mean that when ever we made a change in a parent diagram, such as the 
Context Diagram, the changes will reflect to the proceeding diagrams, if any 
resources were re-used. 

**Forgot to keep track of every day action :( **

## End of Semester

Overall this semester was a challenge to the team seeing that none of us
had any previous experience with MBSE. We spent sprint 1 trying to get the 
appropriate resources such as the licenses for the tool. This carried to the 
first part of Sprint 2. Nonetheless, the team did necessary research 
to get used to the "MBSE ways" seeing that our background was more heavily
in UML. We came out this sprint respecting system engineers
