# Walter Engineering Cuaderno

This notebook's purpose is to keep track of my work done in the project and for the team.

## Sprint 1

Tasks part of

* Literature Review on MagicGrid used on avionics systems.
* Overview on the MagicGrid standards and workflow. 
* Helped design the Jira workflow and its point system
* Discussed with team the best course of action for meetings.
* SDD v1 

Sprint 1 was a very deep planning phase. The project we are attempting to do 
is a subject that is not similar to any single team member (MBSE). Lots
of extensive reseach and literature review was done in order to get the team
familiar with new introduced MBSE methodology. We had a huge block which was 
getting the licenses for MagicDraw as soon as possible. We also had to 
change our scope and actors of the project as per the requirements of 
the licenses.


## Sprint 2

Tasks part of 

* Finalize Literature Review
* Meet with MagicGrid advisor for clear information
* Create System Context Diagram
* Revise and create stakeholder needs
* Read on Conceptual System diagram
* Create Use Case scenario for Use Case
* Test Plan v1 
* SRS v2
* SDD v2
* Planned new meeting times

Sprint 2 started much better than Sprint 1 as the team was able to acquire 
the licenses. But the team was only able to get 2 licenses, and 4 in total 
was needed for the whole team. The team had to speak to the school and agreed
to pay from packet the remaining 2 licenses, one of each was mine. Regardless
the team started creating and designing the first models available. The only 
major blockade the team encountered was having to figure out how to work concurrently
in the project. Many of the diagram, if not all, made it very hard to work on 
alone. The team found themselves having to discuss a lot of the process and things
we wanted to model. Although the end goal seems a bit tight to reach, the 
team started to pick up the pace and found a system that works to faciliate
and accelarate the progress.
