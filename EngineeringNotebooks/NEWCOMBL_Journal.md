Continuing on the context diagram. Trying to also revise the stakeholder needs past our initial list.

I learned that Git merges aren’t going to work for our project, but I figured out the Magic System of Systems Architect project merge feature, and the 3-way merge is ideal for our project and will work for concurrent work.

I created the beginnings of our real system context diagram from our plan.

We met with Akbas and the TA about our project and had our scrum meeting in class.

MagicDraw doesn’t like to merge unrelated projects, and it was faster to re-create my context diagram in Shawn’s project instead of merging them.

We finished the first draft of our system context diagram.

# 10/27/2023
We met with Kathryn to discuss our system context diagram and how to move forward. She told us that our system context looked good, and we just needed to modify our stakeholder needs to be more uniform and use “the system should” instead of “I need.”

We modified the system context diagram a bit, changing arriving and departing crew to just be a bidirectional “crew” arrow.

Today the team met briefly to move forward with the use case diagram. We found out that we did the system context incorrectly even though Kathryn said that it looked good. We have kept that in mind and are following the MagicGrid book of knowledge until we can have another meeting with Kathryn to discuss what she thinks about any discrepancies.

I fixed the system context diagram by changing the stereotype/type of the various external systems away from “External System” which seemed right, but was actually something left in from the MagicGrid v2 template from the car example. We need to create new Actors as blocks and set the type of each Part Property in the system context to each corresponding actor type. Then we could drag the actors directly onto the use case diagram and it worked fine.

I worked on our Sprint 2 demo presentation throughout the morning adding our current work as best as I could. Yesterday the rest of the team worked on creating a use case diagram, or at least the start of one. By the looks of the email that they sent Kathryn they were a bit confused, as I was. It has a use case, and there is a corresponding high-level activity diagram describing what is happening in the use case, and it involves all of the actors in the system. It looks good. My current priority is to understand how that was created, and work on the presentation.

Added our 2nd presentation slides to the GitHub repository

We worked on the Software Design Document updating it with our most current process for creating the models.

We created and added the Sprint 2 Demo presentation to the GitHub repository

Today we identified and categorized our stakeholder requirements and created the measures of effectiveness from the model's current nonfunctional requirements. It was a bit of a challenge figuring out how to assign different measures different unites but we figured it out.


# 11/03/2023

Due to the final end goal of our presentation being to submit a paper about our experience to a reputable journal, we have been researching different opportunities for submitting our research.

# 11/14/2023

Today we revisited our use case scenario for the manage flight use case making it more detailed, referencing a model that we found online as a reference. This will count towards our functional analysis part of the model process for MagicGrid.

Today we met with Kathryn in order to have her review the current state of our model. We got great feedback on our current context diagram and its differences with her context diagram. We were confused about why the relationships in her model were the way that they were. She used composition to the system of interest compared to our model where we thought it made more sense to have an aggregation relationship between the various external components of our model and the external system block. We figured out that the reason that she did that was for later on in the model. We also reconstructed our system context model to be a block definition diagram vs. an internal block diagram. This is because later in the model we will keep those same relationships and MagicDraw will identify those external systems as being a reference rather than a component of the system.

Shawn read the SysML distilled book and helped us fix our model to conform better to well-known SysML practices, although we identified that our model and SysML in general is highly subjective since it is just a modelling language and not a framwork for operation. This has made us respect MagicGrid a lot more.

# 11/28/2023

Today we identified that an early opportunity for showing our work is the Boeing Aviation Safety poster event.

# 11/30/2023

Today we finished up our models to be completely self-consistent and internally complete for our final demonstration. We created our final presentation slides and presented to the class.

# 12/04/2023

Today we created and completed our Boeing CAAS event poster for presenting the current state of our research.

# 12/05/2023

Today since we missed the INCOSE conference so we identified other conferences that we could present our work at.
