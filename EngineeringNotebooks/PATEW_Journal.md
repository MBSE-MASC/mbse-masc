# Clay's Engineering Notebook
This serves as a personal documentation of the things that happened during the course of the semester.
## Sprint One
#### Introduction
For sprint one: we met with clients, decided on a tool, formed our team, created documentation, performed a literature review, and began to look into our tool of choice, MagicDraw.
#### Backlog

#### My Tasks
In this sprint, I worked on the initial documentation and worked on the literature review (MBSE Section) (Link to confluence). 
#### Blockers
We had a few issues with getting our licenses for the tool, which delayed our starting time by arounds a week or two. Despite this, we still held meetings and were able to plan ahead a bit.
We also had issues when trying to scope our problem and decide exactly what our domain should be. We switched clients part way through, which also caused some setbacks.


## Sprint Two
#### Introduction
In this sprint, we began to get more deeply into the MagicGrid Framework, and began work on our models.

#### My Tasks
So far, I have been working on the 'conceptual subsystems' model.
