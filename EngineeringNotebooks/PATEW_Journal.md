# Clay's Engineering Notebook
This serves as a personal documentation of the things that happened during the course of the semester.
## Sprint One
#### Introduction
For sprint one: we met with clients, decided on a tool, formed our team, created documentation, performed a literature review, and began to look into our tool of choice, MagicDraw.
#### My Tasks
In this sprint, I worked on the initial documentation and worked on the literature review (MBSE Section) (Link to confluence). 
#### Blockers
We had a few issues with getting our licenses for the tool, which delayed our starting time by arounds a week or two. Despite this, we still held meetings and were able to plan ahead a bit.
We also had issues when trying to scope our problem and decide exactly what our domain should be. We switched clients part way through, which also caused some setbacks.


## Sprint Two
#### Introduction
In this sprint, we began to get more deeply into the MagicGrid Framework, and began work on our models.
#### Backlog

#### Description
Originally, we planned for me and Walter to work on the conceptual subsystem 
within the system structure column. We worked on this for a while but found
it difficult to vizualize what components may be included in a "generic system",
as many systems could be considered too general (not useful) or as part of the 
implementation (too specific). 

Following this, we discussed our blocker with the stakeholder and decided
to pivot a bit in our approach. We decided, instead of assuming and entirely
generic model, to generate our own 'likely' stakeholder needs largly based on 
NASA's Gateway Spacecraft. This helped us not have to worry about what is/isn't
'generic enough' for the system. 

We generated the following requirements using this approach (first draft):

We then used these to think to refine the external systems:
![Context Model](./resources/context.png)

Next, we created a sample use case for our stakeholder to review:
![usecase](./resources/usecase.png)
![scenario](./resources/scenario.png)

Lastly, we started working on (but did not yet complete) the Measures of Effectiveness.

#### Reflection
In this sprint, my task was mainly to work on the use case and scenario. However,
a majority of our work was done using a whiteboard/open room approach. We held 
frequent meetings (2-3 times per week outside of class) and utilized round
table discussion in both making models and working on the documentation. I believe 
it was a slower, but much better approach to finishing our work.

#### Next Sprint
In sprint 3, we hope to finish the problem domain and will be able to present
a finished model and describe the complex interlinking between them.

## Sprint Three
In this sprint, I worked mainly on the functional analysis model as well as generating
requirements for version 3 of the SRS. As a team, we decided that some of our previous
models needed further iteration.

Here was our backlog for the sprint:

We were able to remake a few of ours and also began work on the new ones. I think that we will
reach our final goal of delivering the project domain of the CCS by the end of the semester
